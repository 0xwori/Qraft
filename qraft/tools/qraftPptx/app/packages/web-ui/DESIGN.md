## Overview

Vercel is a developer-platform brand — the page is a deployment dashboard's marketing surface, written for engineers who already know the syntax. It earns that posture with one of the cleanest stark systems on the web: near-white `{colors.canvas-soft}` body background, ink-near-black `{colors.ink}` text, a 200-step gray scale that gives every divider, border, and disabled state its own deliberate step. The only place the brand introduces colour at marketing scale is the multi-stop mesh gradient (`{colors.gradient-develop-start}` → `{colors.gradient-preview-end}` → `{colors.gradient-ship-start}` → cyan / magenta / amber) that floats in atmospheric backdrops, never miniaturised to a swatch. That gradient is the entire decoration system.

Type is the second decisive voice. The brand's own custom geometric sans (Geist) carries display, body, button — everything narrative — at weight 600 for display, 500 for buttons, 400 for body. A matching monospaced face (Geist Mono) carries technical labels: terminal mockups, code blocks, sometimes filename captions. Headlines are sentence-case with aggressive negative letter-spacing (`-2.4px` at 48 px hero) — the brand never letter-spaces positively, never goes uppercase outside of mono labels.

Surfaces use a four-step ladder: `{colors.canvas}` (pure white for cards), `{colors.canvas-soft}` 98% (the page body), `{colors.canvas-soft-2}` 95% (occasional inset region), `{colors.primary}` (the deep ink-near-black used as the polarity-flipped band when a section needs the dark mode treatment). Shadows are exceptionally subtle — every elevated card carries a stacked shadow built from `0px 1px 1px #00000005` + `0px 2px 2px #0000000a` + an inset border. Cards never float on heavy drop-shadow; they sit on the page held by hairline + soft glow.

**Key Characteristics:**
- A single black-ink primary CTA `{colors.primary}` carries every conversion target, paired with white-on-white `button-secondary` for the secondary action. The brand uses 100 px pill shape for marketing CTAs and a tight 6 px square shape for in-app nav buttons.
- A multi-stop mesh gradient (cyan-blue-magenta-amber) is the only decorative chrome — used at hero scale and inside feature-band atmospheric backdrops. It is the brand.
- Every section eyebrow and small label uses the monospace face `{typography.caption-mono}` or `{typography.code}`; everything else is in the geometric sans.
- Subtle stacked-shadow elevation — three offsets layered with 4-12 % black opacity — never a single heavy drop-shadow.
- A complete 100–1000 gray + blue + red + amber + green + teal + purple + pink colour scale exists as a system token set, but the marketing surface uses only the `100`, `1000`, and `700`-level tones; the rest stay in the design-system tokens for in-product surfaces.
- An "Active CPU" pricing rhythm: `pricing-card` lays out 3-up on the pricing page with `pricing-card-featured` (Pro tier) polarity-flipped to `{colors.primary}` against white-card siblings.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Ink** (`{colors.primary}` — `#171717`): The single primary CTA color. Black-near-pure ink that carries every Sign Up pill, every footer CTA, the dark-band polarity-flip. Used as text color throughout the page on light surfaces. (Resolved from `--ds-gray-1000`.)
- **Cyan** (`{colors.cyan}` — `#50e3c2`): A signature mint-cyan used in the brand gradient and inside Geist-system spotlight tokens. Visible inside the hero gradient stops.
- **Highlight Pink** (`{colors.highlight-pink}` — `#ff0080`): The brand's highlight magenta, used as the high-saturation stop in the preview-gradient pair.
- **Violet** (`{colors.violet}` — `#7928ca`): The deep purple used as the start of the preview-gradient and inside developer-console highlights.
- **Link Blue** (`{colors.link}` — `#0070f3`): The brand's primary link color and the legacy `--geist-success` semantic.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): The pure-white card / dialog / modal surface.
- **Canvas Soft** (`{colors.canvas-soft}` — `#fafafa`): The default page background — 98 % white. Almost every section sits on this tone.
- **Canvas Soft 2** (`{colors.canvas-soft-2}` — `#f5f5f5`): A slightly deeper inset surface for "code editor inner background", template-card hover states, and dropdown menus.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#ebebeb`): 1 px dividers — table rows, card borders, input borders.
- **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#a1a1a1`): The 500-level gray, used as the slightly-stronger divider on light bands and as the deemphasised text color.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#171717`): Every heading and body paragraph on light surfaces.
- **Body** (`{colors.body}` — `#4d4d4d`): Secondary text — sub-headings, body captions, nav-link inactive text, footer column body.
- **Mute** (`{colors.mute}` — `#888888`): Lowest-priority text — placeholder text, fine print, low-key labels.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): All text on `{colors.primary}` surfaces.

### Semantic
- **Success / Link** (`{colors.success}` — `#0070f3`): The brand's legacy success indicator doubles as the primary link color. Visible underline-on-hover for inline body links.
- **Link Deep** (`{colors.link-deep}` — `#0761d1`): The pressed / visited tone for inline links.
- **Link Bg Soft** (`{colors.link-bg-soft}` — `#d3e5ff`): Soft pastel blue fill for "what's new" pill banners and informational badges.
- **Error** (`{colors.error}` — `#ee0000`): Validation red for destructive actions and form errors.
- **Error Soft** (`{colors.error-soft}` — `#f7d4d6`): Soft pastel red for destructive-state backgrounds.
- **Error Deep** (`{colors.error-deep}` — `#c50000`): Pressed / deep destructive state.
- **Warning** (`{colors.warning}` — `#f5a623`): Caution / pending status indicator.
- **Warning Soft** (`{colors.warning-soft}` — `#ffefcf`) / **Warning Deep** (`{colors.warning-deep}` — `#ab570a`): Background + pressed variants.

### Brand Gradient
The brand's signature decoration is a three-pair gradient stack:
- **Develop** (`{colors.gradient-develop-start}` `#007cf0` → `{colors.gradient-develop-end}` `#00dfd8`) — the blue-to-teal pair used to mark the "deploy" / "develop" rhythm.
- **Preview** (`{colors.gradient-preview-start}` `#7928ca` → `{colors.gradient-preview-end}` `#ff0080`) — the violet-to-pink pair used for "preview" surfaces.
- **Ship** (`{colors.gradient-ship-start}` `#ff4d4d` → `{colors.gradient-ship-end}` `#f9cb28`) — the coral-to-amber pair used for "ship" surfaces.

The three pairs collapse into a single multi-color mesh gradient when used as the hero atmospheric backdrop. Treat the gradient as one unified object — do not crop down to a single colour, do not reorder the stops, and do not miniaturise. Used at hero scale only.

## Typography

### Font Family
Two custom faces carry the entire system:

1. **A custom geometric sans** (extracted as `Geist`) for every display, body, button, link, and label. Weights 400 / 500 / 600 are the working set; the face never appears in 700 or heavier. Display sizes are tracked aggressively negative (`-2.4 px` at 48 px hero, `-1.28 px` at 32 px section); body stays at neutral or slightly-negative tracking.
2. **A custom monospaced face** (extracted as `Geist Mono`) for terminal mockups, code blocks, and small mono-caption labels — anything that wants to signal "technical." Weight 400 only at 12 – 13 px. Tracking neutral.

In this codebase the two faces are substituted with **Inter** (geometric sans) and **JetBrains Mono** (monospace), self-hosted via `@fontsource/inter` and `@fontsource/jetbrains-mono` and registered in `main.tsx` with `font-display: swap`.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 48px | 600 | 48px | -2.4px | Hero headline ("Build and deploy on the AI Cloud."). |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 32px | 600 | 40px | -1.28px | Section headlines. |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 24px | 600 | 32px | -0.96px | Card-cluster headlines, pricing-tier names. |
| `{typography.display-sm}` | 20px | 600 | 28px | -0.6px | Inline display micro-headings. |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 28px | 0 | Lead paragraphs under section headlines. |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 24px | 0 | Default body paragraph. |
| `{typography.body-md-strong}` | 16px | 500 | 24px | 0 | Bolded inline body. |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 20px | -0.28px | Secondary body, nav-link text, button-md labels. |
| `{typography.body-sm-strong}` | 14px | 500 | 20px | -0.28px | Nav CTA labels, table-row emphasis. |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 400 | 16px | 0 | Footer secondary lines, badge labels. |
| `{typography.caption-mono}` | 12px | 400 | 16px | 0 | Section eyebrows and label captions that want a technical voice. |
| `{typography.code}` | 13px | 400 | 20px | 0 | Inline code, terminal mockups, command snippets. |
| `{typography.button-md}` | 14px | 500 | 20px | 0 | Small / nav-scale button labels. |
| `{typography.button-lg}` | 16px | 500 | 24px | 0 | Marketing-scale pill button labels. |

### Principles
- **Negative tracking is part of the voice.** Display sizes use aggressive `-2.4` to `-0.6` px tracking. Reverting to default tracking breaks the brand.
- **Sentence-case headlines, period-terminated.** Headlines like "Build and deploy on the AI Cloud." end with a deliberate period — that punctuation is part of the brand's voice.
- **Mono for the technical layer only.** Section eyebrows, code blocks, terminal mockups. Body paragraphs never set in mono.
- **Weight 600 is the display ceiling.** The geometric sans never appears at 700 / 800. The brand reads as a calmer system because of this.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 4 px. The brand's `--geist-space` token is exactly 4 px and every captured value is a multiple of 4.
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 4 px · `{spacing.xs}` 8 px · `{spacing.sm}` 12 px · `{spacing.md}` 16 px · `{spacing.lg}` 24 px · `{spacing.xl}` 32 px · `{spacing.2xl}` 40 px · `{spacing.3xl}` 48 px · `{spacing.4xl}` 64 px · `{spacing.5xl}` 96 px · `{spacing.6xl}` 128 px · `{spacing.section}` 192 px.
- **Section padding**: marketing bands use `{spacing.4xl}` to `{spacing.5xl}` top/bottom. Hero bands stretch to `{spacing.section}` to give the mesh gradient room to breathe.
- **Card interior padding**: marketing cards sit at `{spacing.lg}` to `{spacing.xl}`; template-grid cards stay tighter at `{spacing.md}` because they sit in a denser grid.
- **Inline gap**: button rows, nav rows, and chip rows use `{spacing.sm}` to `{spacing.md}` between siblings.

### Grid & Container
- **Max width**: ~1400 px (`--ds-page-width`); the legacy `--geist-page-width` is 1200 px and still appears on some marketing surfaces. Content centres with horizontal gutters of `{spacing.lg}` 24 px on desktop, `{spacing.md}` 16 px on mobile.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The mesh gradient does most of the heavy decorative lifting; whitespace separates the bands. Section spacing is generous — `{spacing.4xl}` to `{spacing.5xl}` between bands lets the gradient breathe. Inside a card, the headline/paragraph stack is tight (`{spacing.xs}` 8 px gap), then a wider gap before the CTA cluster.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Level 0 — Flat | No shadow, no border. | Full-bleed hero bands and the polarity-flipped dark sections. |
| Level 1 — Inset Hairline | `0 0 0 1px #00000014` inset 1 px border. | Default card chrome. |
| Level 2 — Subtle Drop | `0px 1px 1px #00000005, 0px 2px 2px #0000000a` plus inset hairline. | Slightly elevated cards. |
| Level 3 — Soft Stack | `0px 2px 2px #0000000a, 0px 8px 8px -8px #0000000a` plus inset hairline. | "Medium" elevation — feature-grid cards. |
| Level 4 — Float Stack | `0px 2px 2px #0000000a, 0px 8px 16px -4px #0000000a` plus inset hairline. | "Large" elevation — pricing cards, callout panels. |
| Level 5 — Modal | `0px 1px 1px #00000005, 0px 8px 16px -4px #0000000a, 0px 24px 32px -8px #0000000f` plus inset hairline. | Modal / dialog surfaces and dropdown menus. |

- `button-primary-sm` / `button-secondary-sm` — same colors, `body-sm-strong` label, 100 px pill at smaller height.
- `nav-cta-signup` (`button` variant `nav-primary` size `nav`) — 6 px radius, ink fill, 28 px tall.
- `nav-cta-login` / `nav-cta-ask-ai` (`button` variant `nav-secondary` size `nav`) — white with hairline border.
- `tab-ghost` (`tabs` variant `ghost`) — 64 px radius pill row.

### Cards
- `card-marketing` — canvas bg, 24 px padding, 8 px radius, Level 3 stacked shadow.
- `card-marketing-large` — canvas bg, 32 px padding, 12 px radius, Level 4 stacked shadow.
- `pricing-card-featured` / `card variant="featured"` — polarity-flipped (ink bg, canvas text) for the "active deck" highlight in the Library.
- `code-editor-mockup` — `{colors.primary}` bg, mono body, 24 px padding, 8 px radius.

### Inputs & Forms
- `form-input` — 40 px tall, 6 px radius, hairline border, body-sm.
- `form-input-sm` — 32 px tall.
- `form-input-lg` — 48 px tall, body-md (16 px).

### Navigation
- `nav-bar` — 64 px tall white sticky header.
- `nav-link` — `body-sm` body color, ghost pill on hover/active.

### Signature Components
- `hero-band` — canvas bg, mesh-gradient backdrop, `display-xl` headline (sentence case + period), `body-lg` lede, `button-primary` + `button-secondary` CTA row.
- `mesh-gradient` — radial-gradient stack composed of the three brand-gradient pairs. Hero scale only.
- `mono-eyebrow` — uppercase JetBrains Mono caption above section headlines.
- `showcase-band-dark` — `{colors.primary}` bg with white-on-black headline; used to wrap the editor canvas backdrop.
- `badge-secondary` — pill chip on `canvas-soft`.
- `link-inline` — body-md, `{colors.link}`, underline on hover.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` (`#171717`) for primary CTAs across the page. Black ink IS the conversion target.
- Use `{rounded.pill}` 100 px for every marketing-scale CTA and `{rounded.sm}` 6 px for nav-scale buttons. The two pill scales coexist deliberately.
- Set every headline in `{typography.display-*}` weight 600, sentence-case, often period-terminated. Aggressive negative tracking is part of the voice.
- Use the brand mesh gradient as atmospheric decoration at hero scale only — never miniaturise it to an icon, never reduce to a single colour.
- Layer stacked shadows (multiple small offsets with inset hairline) rather than single heavy drops. The brand's elevation is calmer than Material.
- Cycle page surfaces in `{colors.canvas-soft}` → `{colors.canvas}` → `{colors.primary}` polarity-flipped bands; the dark band IS the depth cue.
- Set every code block and technical eyebrow in `{typography.code}` / `{typography.caption-mono}`. Mono is the voice of the platform.

### Don't
- Don't introduce a sixth accent colour. The brand operates with ink + gray + the four-pair gradient palette; new accents flatten the voice.
- Don't render headlines in all-caps. Sentence-case + negative tracking is non-negotiable.
- Don't drop a single heavy drop-shadow on cards. The brand's elevation is built from stacked small offsets + inset hairline rings.
- Don't render the brand gradient at icon scale or in a single-colour reduced form. The gradient lives at hero scale only.
- Don't promote the geometric sans to weight 700. The brand's display ceiling is 600.
- Don't pair the marketing 100-px pill CTA shape with the 6-px nav radius on the same screen — pick a scale and stay there.
- Don't set body paragraphs in the mono face. The mono is for code + technical labels only.
